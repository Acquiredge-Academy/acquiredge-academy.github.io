<p>This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your Mac for coursework at AcquirEdge. The steps neeed to be completed in the order provided. There might be some video clips. pictures, and commands in this guide, but be sure to read through the instructions thoroughly as you go so you don't accidentally skip a step.</p>
<h2 id="check-system-requirements">Check System Requirements</h2>
<p>First, make sure that your Mac Laptop or Desktop meets these system requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer* less than 4 years old (depending on how fast it is)</li>
<li>Intel, M1, or M2 processor</li>
<li>8GB RAM <strong>minimum</strong>, 16GB recommended</li>
<li>8GB of free disk space <strong>minimum</strong></li>
<li>macOS version 11 (Big Sur) or later</li>
</ul>
<p>If your macOS version is older than 11 (Big Sur), please update it now before comtinuing.</p>
<p>You can verify the version of your macOS by following <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260">these steps</a>. You can update your version of macOS with the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541">built-in <strong>Software Update</strong> app</a>.</p>
<h2 id="install-xcode-command-line-tools">Install Xcode Command Line Tools</h2>
<p>At AcquirEdge, you will use Git and GitHub, just like a professional developer. To enable Git on macOS, install the Xcode Command Line Tools. This is done using the <strong>Terminal</strong> app that comes with macOS.</p>
<h3 id="open-a-new-terminal-window">Open a new Terminal Window</h3>
<ol>
<li>Press <kbd>‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd></li>
<li>Type <strong>Terminal</strong> and press <kbd>Return</kbd>.</li>
<li>A <strong>Terminal</strong> window should appear.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the below command into <strong>Terminal</strong> and press <kbd>Return</kbd>.
   <code>xcode-select --install</code></li>
</ol>
<p>When you are prompted to install command line developer tools, click <strong>Install</strong> and <strong>Agree</strong> to the Command Line Tools License Agreement and wait for the installation to complete before moving on. You might see a huge time estimate like 80 hours, but it won't take that long üòÜ.</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ö†Ô∏è If you receive an error message saying that <code>command line tools are already installed</code>, then Git is already enabled on your Mac and you can <strong>jump to the next section of this guide</strong>.</li>
<li>‚ö†Ô∏è If installing the command line developer tools fails, try downloading and installing them manually. You can find the latest version of <strong>Command Line Tools for Xcode</strong> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=command%20line%20tools">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="install-visual-studio-code">Install Visual Studio Code</h2>
<p>For editing code for our program, we'll be using Microsoft's <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>.</p>
<p>If you already have Visual Studio Code installed, you can skip to the next section called "Setting up Visual Studio Code". We'll be creating a new Profile for our course, so it shouldn't interfere with your existing settings.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Head to the offical Visual Studio Code installation site <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">here</a> and select the version for macOS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the download completes, you should see a file similar to <code>VSCode-darwin-universal.zip</code> in your "Downloads" Folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the <code>.zip</code> file, and drag the "Visual Studio Code" application into your "Applications" Folder. Optionally, if you'd like to have a desktop shortcut, drag the "Visual Studio Code" application onto your Desktop, too.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="setting-up-visual-studio-code">Setting Up Visual Studio Code</h3>
<p>To make the setup process simple, I've already created a default profile for you with the necessary extensions and settings for our program. To install it, follow the instructions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Visual Studio Code.</li>
<li>Click on the Gear <kbd>‚öôÔ∏è</kbd> at the bottom left.</li>
<li>Click on "Profile (Default)" &gt; "Import Profile"</li>
<li>In the window that opens at the top of VS Code, paste this link: <code>https://vscode.dev/profile/github/f5597bb40b094a95f2276151cb2b88c9</code> and hit <kbd>Return</kbd>.</li>
<li>In the panel that opens on the left, click the blue <kbd style="background-color: lightblue">Create Profile</kbd> button.</li>
<li>Finally, in the window that opens up at the top of VS Code, click the blue <kbd style="background-color: lightblue">Create</kbd> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Great! Now your VS Code is all set up with our default settings and extensions!</p>
<p>If you have extra settings you'd want to change, feel free to come back to VS Code and change your settings after completing our setup guide!</p>
<h2 id="connect-visual-studio-code-to-your-github-account">Connect Visual Studio Code to your GitHub account</h2>
<p>To avoid needing to log in to GitHub every time you wish to accept and submit an assignment, we're going to connect your VS Code to your GitHub account using something called <strong>SSH</strong>.</p>
<p>This requires us to create a key using the <strong>Terminal</strong> Application, and then pasting the key in your GitHub account.</p>
<h3 id="create-your-ssh-public-key">Create your SSH Public Key</h3>
<p>To create an SSH Public Key, it's actually quite simple.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open up your <strong>Terminal</strong> Application, and run the following command, replacing <code>your_email@example.com</code> with your GitHub email:
   <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be propmted to <code>&gt; Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/YOU/.ssh/id_rsa):[Press enter]</code>. Simply press <kbd>Return</kbd> to continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When prompted for a passphrase, just press <kbd>Return</kbd> twice to create an empty passphrase. We won't need one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To verify that you've created your SSH Public Key, run the following command in <strong>Terminal</strong>: <code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>. You should see a long string of characters that starts with "ssh-rsa" and ends with the email you provided for your key above. Keep this window open, we will need it for the next section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="add-your-ssh-public-key-to-github">Add your SSH Public Key to GitHub.</h3>
<p>Sign into your GitHub account and go to <a href="https://github.com/settings/keys">https://github.com/settings/keys</a>. Click <strong>New SSH key</strong> on GitHub. Give the new key a name that will remind you which computer you pasted the key from. Copy-paste your key from Terminal into GitHub and click <strong>Add SSH key</strong>. If given the option, choose <strong>Authentication Key</strong> as the <strong>Key type</strong>.</p>
<p>To confirm that your SSH key was properly added to GitHub, go back to the Terminal app and paste in the following command, then press <kbd>Return</kbd>. Because this may be the first time that you are connecting your Mac to GitHub over SSH, you might receive a confirmation message asking you if you want to continue connecting. Type <code>yes</code> and press <kbd>Return</kbd>. After that, you should receive a message confirming that <strong>you've successfully authenticated</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>  ssh git@github.com
</code></pre>
<h2 id="add-your-name-and-email-address-to-git">Add your name and email address to Git</h2>
<p>After your SSH key has been successfully uploaded to GitHub and you have verified that your Mac authenticates successfully, update Git to remember your name and email address. This should be your full name and the email address you used to sign up with GitHub.</p>
<p>Enter the following commands into <strong>Terminal</strong> to set your name and email address, <strong>but use your own name and email address instead of the examples</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>  git config --global user.name "Joe King"
  git config --global user.email "joe@email.org"
</code></pre>
<p>You can check for typos with the following command. You may see some other values print, but the most important things to check are your name and email address. You can fix typos by running the above commands again.</p>
<pre><code>  git config --global --list
</code></pre>
<h2 id="creating-your-solutions-repository-from-git">Creating your solutions repository from Git</h2>
<p>Here at AcquirEdge, we want you to <em>own</em> your own work so that even after this program ends, you'll forever have access to your code and projects we built in this program.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, you will create a repository off of one of our templates.</p>
<p>Your solutions repository will contain all of the program's coursework, which will be delivered to you by your instructor on a set schedule.</p>
<h3 id="creating-your-solutions-repository">Creating your solution's repository</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure you are signed in to your GitHub account. Then, head to <a href="https://www.github.com/AcquirEdge-Academy/fundamentals-first-solutions">https://www.github.com/AcquirEdge-Academy/fundamentals-first-solutions</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Near the top right, locate and click the <kbd style="background-color: green; color: white; font-weight: 800;">Use this template</kbd> button. Click it, and select the dropdown option for <strong>Create a new repository</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It should open up a screen that says <strong>Create a new repository</strong>. Edit the <strong>Repository name</strong> field to <code>fundamentals-first-solutions-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME</code>, replacing "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" with your own GitHub username.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit the <strong>Description</strong> field so that it says "[YOUR FULL NAME]'s Solutions Repository", replacing [YOUR FULL NAME] with your full name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <kbd style="background-color: green; color: white; font-weight: 800;">Create repository</kbd>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait a few seconds for the process to complete, and you have now created your solutions repository!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="add-your-instructor-as-a-collaborator">Add your instructor as a collaborator</h3>
<p>When you sent a Discord message to your instructor, you should have received a message back containing your instructor's GitHub username. (If you did not, you can assume that it is "AcquirEdge"). In order for an instructor to review your changes and <strong>provide feedback</strong> on your commits, you need to <strong>add them as a collaborator</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your solutions repository in your personal GitHub. Click on the <kbd>‚öôÔ∏è Settings</kbd> button at the very top.</li>
<li>Under "<strong>Access</strong>" on the left hand side, click on "<strong>Collaborators</strong>".</li>
<li>In the big box that appears, click <kbd style="background-color: green; color: white; font-weight: 800;">Add people</kbd></li>
<li>Type your instructor's GitHub username, and click on them when you see their account appear. You should then see one row in the box that says "Pending Invite".</li>
<li>At some point prior to your first class session, your instructor will accept this invitation. Your work here is done for now.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="clone-your-solutions-repository">Clone your solutions repository</h3>
<p>In this section you are going to download a copy of your solutions repository onto your computer in Visual Studio Code.</p>
<ol>
<li>Be signed into your personal GitHub account at <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a></li>
<li>Got to your <strong>Repositories</strong> page.</li>
<li>Find your code solutions repository and click on it.</li>
<li>Open <strong>Visual Studio Code.</strong></li>
<li>In your file explorer, click on the blue <kbd style="background-color: lightblue">Clone Repository</kbd> button. You should see a window appear at the top.</li>
<li>Back on your GitHub repository page, click the <kbd style="background-color: green; color:white">&lt;&gt; Code</kbd> button and copy the <strong>SSH URL</strong> from your repository. <strong>Do not copy the HTTPS URL, only the SSH URL will work.</strong></li>
<li>Paste the URL back in the box in Visual Studio Code, and click "Clone from URL". You should see a file explorer window open asking you where to save your local repository. I would recommend selecting your Desktop Folder.</li>
<li>VS Code will then ask you if you want to open the cloned repository. Hit "<strong>Open</strong>".</li>
</ol>
<p>Great! If you ran into any problems, please contact an instructor via Discord. Otherwise, you have succesfully created and cloned your solutions repository!</p>
<h2 id="closing-and-re-opening-your-solutions-repository">Closing and re-opening your solutions repository</h2>
<p>This section of the guide shows you how to open your solutions back up after you have closed them. Visual Studio Code keeps a history of which repositories, files, and projects you have opened. You can see them by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close Visual Studio Code.</li>
<li>Reopen Visual Studio Code.</li>
<li>Go to the <strong>File</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open Recent...</strong></li>
<li>Choose your recently closed code solutions repository.</li>
<li>Wait a moment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nice! Your repository should open back up again! You should also see any files you previously had open before closing Visual Studio Code. Remember, any time you want to return to your solutions repository, you can get it via <strong>File &gt; Open Recent...</strong></p>
