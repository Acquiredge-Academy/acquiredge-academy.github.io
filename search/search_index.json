In fact, coming out of this course, we're really just scratching the surface, which is precisely the point. Mastering the ability to code is a career-long journey, but getting project-ready , where you are able to create real applications to see the results of your work doesn't have to be difficult. Most guides and tutorials out there tend to overload beginners with unnecessary details that distract them from the core concepts in the beginning. By following through with this program, you will be able to go from \"zero\" (absolute beginner) to \"project-ready\" in the fastest way possible. Sometimes, there will be links to additional readings, but the core material is focused on getting rid of distracting details so that we can focus on building and experimenting. Guiding Philosophies and Strategic Shortcuts Hands-On Learning Going through readings and videos can help build a basic understanding of code, but you're not going to fully \"get it\" without carefully working through exercises and examples. Each reading aligns to coding exercises for you to complete in your assignment repository. You will need to make sure to import the correct assignment code prior to beginning your readings . Content for each section builds on knowledge from prior sections. So, it's important to fully understand each section before moving to the next. Emphasis on Vocabulary Learning technical vocabulary is super important for a number of reasons: Being able to speak using precise terms shows a high level of understanding. Knowing the right terms will help when you're asking for help, whether that be on the internet or from a person. We'll call out key terms in each section and link to a terminology table. Avoid Pitfalls Here are a list of common mistakes that many introductory coding students make. Try to follow these guidelines to maximize your learning: Code in small chunks and test along the way. This will help you identify and fix errors early, before they get difficult to find. When your code doesn't work, follow the scientific method: Hypothesize, test, learn, repeat. Do NOT copy-paste code. If you're receiving help online, make sure to read, understand, and then write it yourself. The point in the beginning is to get as much practice as you can, and copy-pasting is simply robbing yourself of this practice. Choose variable names that represent the data well. Avoid general names like a and b . Embrace reading documentation. Most professionals rely on documentation more than any other resource. What's being simplified One tool for every job We won't show you all of the different ways to copmlete a task in code. We'll show you the one way that is the best option 90% of the time. One equality operator Although we'll introduce the difference, we will not be using the == operator in this course, and we don't use it much in the real world, either. Stick to === . JQuery for DOM manipulation and HTTP requests We've tried teaching \"Vanilla JavaScript\", but it's quite difficult to get the hang of in the beginning. Instead, we've opted to use JQuery because it simplifies a lot of concepts in DOM Manipulation and HTTP requests, which are concepts that can be difficult to understand as it is. However, it is recommended to learn how to work without JQuery after you are comfortable with the concepts, and we will include resources for you to learn that after the course concludes. External Resources Sometimes, you will be directed to utilize external resources for learning. Generally, this happens when another resource already does a good job of simplifying the information and concisely teaching a topic. Note about ChatGPT Do NOT ask ChatGPT to code for you in this coursee. It will not help you at this stage of your learning. You can , however, ask it to help explain concepts to you or find additional resources for you. There's 2 main reasons why you shouldn't realy on ChatGPT just yet to help you with coding: 1. Hinders Learning Do you know what your main job as a programmer is? It's not actually coding. It's problem solving using code. That being said, if you don't go through the motions of writing code on your own in the beginning, you'll never develop the skills of problem solving and logic, which will cause enormous issues for you when you actually try to get a job. 2. ChatGPT Sucks at Coding Seriously. Sometimes, ChatGPT will come up with some good code. But usually it comes up with code that is not optimal, efficient, or, worse, even correct! As a beginner, you won't have the experience to recognize these issues, leading to learning and developing poor coding practices. \"But, professional developers say they use ChatGPT for work!\" . Yes, it's true. Many professional developers do in fact use ChatGPT at work, and it can improve their work efficiency. However . You are not a professional developer (not yet, anyways). The real reason why professionals use ChatGPT is because it can write code really fast , not because the code is of good quality . ChatGPT can write a lot of very simple boilerplate code very quickly, which a developer can then come back and implement the more difficult portions of. Conclusion Don't use ChatGPT to code just yet. You can use it to ask questions about concepts, or ask for advice on where to find resources. However, asking ChatGPT to code for you will only hinder your learning and cause you to come up with bad code. Also, it's pretty obvious to any professional developer when we see AI-generated code.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"The goal of this course is not to turn you into a master JavaScript developer.

PREP is a mnemonic to guide you through methodically tackling these problems. The letters in P.R.E.P. stand for Parameters, Return, Example, Pseudocode. Let's practice using PREP through this example problem: Write a function that accepts a sentence and returns the longest word. \"P\" is for Parameters In this step we are thinking about our function's inputs: What parameters will our function accept? What type will each of our parameters have? What are meaningful names for our parameters? Look for keywords like \"accepts\" or \"takes in\" in the problem description to guide you. The statement \u201caccepts a sentence\u201d tells you that the function should accept a single String parameter. You could name this parameter sentenceString to make the type crystal clear, but it's pretty obvious that just sentence implies a String, and it's more concise. Since this is your first step, you also need to think of a meaningful name for your function itself. In your case, longestWord is both concise and descriptive. Now that you've decided this, you can write the shell for your function like this: function longestWord(sentence){ } \"R\" is for Return What data type does this function return? Is it a number? A boolean? A string? Remember: the value a function returns is not the same as what it might display in a print/log statement. Once again, you can look at the problem statement for clarification. \"Returns the longest word\" tells you that you're returning a word, and you know that words are strings. Let's make this crystal clear by creating a variable to represent this return value and rigging up your function to return it. Even though you aren't returning the correct answer yet, you're set up to return the correct type. You have created a placeholder that will make the next steps easier. function longestWord(sentence){ let word = 'placeholder'; return word; } \"E\" is for Example Even for expert developers, static code is harder to understand than running code. You want to make your code runnable and \u201calive\u201d as soon as possible. You can breathe life into your function with an example test invocation. You know that if your function accepts the sentence, 'I saw a hippopotamus', it should return the string 'hippopotamus' once it's properly working. But for now, you just want to see your placeholder value from the last step to confirm your code is runnable and setup correctly. function longestWord(sentence){ let word = 'placeholder'; return word; } console.log(longestWord('I saw a hippopotamus')); Last \"P\" is for Pseudocode While it's tempting to just dive in and start coding now, it would be too easy to get caught up in a detail that could distract you from the bigger picture. You need to devise a strategy first, and pseudocoding is just the tactic for this. Pseudocode is a series of precise statements written in spoken language comments that describe what you need to do. function longestWord(sentence){ // Use a variable to keep track of the longest word so far. let word = 'placeholder'; // Convert the sentence into an array of words, so we can easily // iterate over each word. // Loop through each of the words. // If the length of the current word is greater than the longest // so far, update our variable tracking the longest word. // After we've looked at every word, return the tracking variable. return word; } // This should log \"hippopotamus\" once our function is working // correctly. Currently, it logs \"placeholder\" console.log(longestWord('I saw a hippopotamus')); You've finished PREP. Now you can code! The four steps in PREP helped you clearly frame the problem and think about how to solve it. In truth, accurate framing is half the battle. At this point, your goal is to just write code that will make your examples and tests pass. You'll do this by encoding each of your pseudocode steps. You know you've got a working solution when you can run your code and see the correct output. function longestWord(sentence){ // Use a variable to keep track of the longest word so far. let longestWordSoFar = \"\"; // Convert the sentence into an array of words, so we can easily // iterate over each word. let wordArray = sentence.split(\" \"); let currentWord; // Loop through each of the words. for (let i = 0; i < wordArray.length; i++){ currentWord = wordArray[i]; // If the length of the current word is greater than the longest // so far, update our variable tracking the longest word. if (currentWord.length > longestWordSoFar.length){ longestWordSoFar = currentWord; } } // after we've looked at every word, return the tracking variable return longestWordSoFar; } // This should log \"hippopotamus\" once our function is working // correctly. console.log(longestWord('I saw a hippopotamus'));","title":"PREP"},{"location":"bonus/PREP/#problem-solving-and-algorithms-with-prep","text":"","title":"Problem Solving and Algorithms with PREP"},{"location":"bonus/PREP/#prep","text":"Many coding problems you encounter will involve writing functions to perform specific tasks.

Only work on ONE assignment at a time, otherwise things can get messed up very quickly. This guide seems long, but after you get used to the workflow, it will take you 30 seconds to start an assignment. Introduction At AcquirEdge, you're going to learn a workflow used by almost every professional developer out there. This workflow is commonly referred to as the GitHub Flow . Key Concepts A handful of terms and concepts are important to understand while starting an assignment: files - Individual pieces of data stored on a computer, like .html documents, .jpg images, or .mp3 audio. directories - Commonly referred to as \"folders\" because of the icons used to represent them. Used to group together files and other directories . git - The command line version control tool used to manage our assignment solutions. repository - A collection of files and directories that git can manage. commit - A snapshot of a repository at some point in time. branch - An isolated timeline of commits GitHub - A web application built to let developers manage their repositories online and collaborate with others. pull - Download one or more commits from GitHub to your computer. Avoid these Mistakes Git is hard . Any profesional software developer would agree. But, as with many other things, Git is a necessary \"evil\" that will actually make your life easier -- as long as you're using it correctly. Here are some common mistakes you can avoid while practicing the GitHub flow and working on assignment solutions. If you can avoid these, your life will be easier. Don't rush or skip any steps outlined for you. Don't start working on more than one assignment solution at a time. Don't ignore the terminal output. Read carefully and ask questions if you don't understand something. Don't try random \"fixes\" for git that you find on Google before confirming with an instructor first. You are normally encouraged to figure things out on your own, but if you follow these steps properly, you won't need to \"fix\" any git problems. Don't make any changes to files on the GitHub website. Only change your files in VS Code. Don't forget that you can come back to this guide and re-read it anytime. Instructions Let's get started with starting an assignment. You should have received or have access to a .zip or .tar.gz file containing your assignment files prior to beginning these instructions. Detailed Instructions Note : Windows and MacOS are going to be using different shell applications, with MacOS using Terminal and Windows using Git Bash , which you installed during the onboarding guide. If you are a Windows user and see Terminal in the instructions, you can assume I mean Git Bash for you. Note : There is one set of instructions for both MacOS and Windows. Assume that Enter and Return are interchangable. Note : These steps might be confusing at first because your branch , solution directory , and assignment have the same name, but don't forget that directories and branches are NOT the same thing! (See above). Note : If you receive an error in your terminal, the first thing to check is if you made a typo . You can scroll up in your terminal to see your last command. Open your solutions repository in VS code . (This was covered in the onboarding guide ) Open the Integrated Terminal in VS Code by pressing CTRL + ` OR CMD + J . Switch to the main branch of your solutions repository with the following command. Type this command into the terminal and press ENTER . You should receive no errors. git switch main Pull any commits merged into the main branch on GitHub . For your first assignment, there won't be any. But do it anyways to start practicing. Type this command into the terminal and press Enter . You should recieve no errors, although you may be given a summary of the changes that were pulled if any. git pull origin main Create and switch to a new branch for the assignment you are doing. Your branch name should be the exact same name as the assignment itself. Run the below command and replace name-of-assignment with the name of the assignment. For example, if we're doing the \"example\" assignment, the name-of-assignment should be replaced with example . Or, if we're doing the \"variables-and-data\" assignment, replace it with variables-and-data instead. git branch -b name-of-assignment Confirm that your new branch was created and that you are currently checked out to your new branch by running the command below. You should see a \" * \" symbol next to your newly created branch name. git branch Note: If you made a typo, use git branch -D name-of-branch to delete the bad branch, and start over from step 5. Locate the .zip or .tar.gz file provided by your instructor for the assignment you're attempting to start. Extract the folder and starter files . Follow the instructions below depending on your operating System. For macOS : Find the downloaded .zip or .tar.gz file (Usually in Downloads folder if you didn't move it) Double-click the file to extract it. A new folder with the name of the assignment will be created. Drag the new assignment folder into the Bottom of the left column in Visual Studio Code to copy the starter files into your solutions repository. For Windows : Find the downloaded .zip or .tar.gz file (Usually in Downloads folder if you didn't move it) Right-click the file to bring up the context menu. If you have 7zip downloaded, you should see an option to \"Extract all...\". (On Windows 11, you may need to click \"Show more options\" first). Click this option, and 7zip should offer to extract the folder to the same location as the original compreessed file. Click OK . A new folder with the name of the assignment will be created. You may need to scroll around your file Explorer to find it Drag the new assignment folder into the Bottom of the left column in Visual Studio Code to copy the starter files into your solutions repository. The new assignment files in your VS Code should turn green . Back in the Integrated terminal, run the following 2 commands to take a snapshot of your assignment before beginning. This will ensure that even if you forget to save some code and your computer crashes, you at least won't have to go through the setup instructions again. Replace name-of-assignment with the name of your current assignment. git add . git commit -m \"name-of-assignment initial commit\" Carefully read the Learning Objectives section of an assignment before beginning. These are your learning objectives, and you will be asked quiz questions at the end of the assignment on these objectives. Complete the assignment according to the instructions. Make sure to extract the files into your solutions repository , which you set up in your onboarding instructions.","title":"Starting an Assignment"},{"location":"guides/starting-an-assignment/#starting-an-assignment","text":"Steps to follow before each individual assignment.

This will ensure that even if you forget to save some code and your computer crashes, you at least won't have to go through the setup instructions again. Replace name-of-assignment with the name of your current assignment. git add . git commit -m \"name-of-assignment initial commit\" Carefully read the Learning Objectives section of an assignment before beginning. These are your learning objectives, and you will be asked quiz questions at the end of the assignment on these objectives. Complete the assignment according to the instructions. Make sure to extract the files into your solutions repository , which you set up in your onboarding instructions.","title":"Detailed Instructions"},{"location":"guides/submitting-an-assignment/","text":"Submitting an Assignment Steps to follow after each individual assignment. Only work on ONE assignment at a time, otherwise things can get messed up pretty quickly. This guide seems long, but after you get used to the workflow, it should go past pretty quickly. Key Concepts A handful of terms and concepts that are important to understand while submitting an assignment: Pull Request : A request to merge code changes from one branch into another, often reviewed by other developers. origin : The default nickname for the remote repository where your local repository is connected to. Staging a file : Preparing a file for commit by adding it to the staging area. Tracked files : Files that Git is monitoring for changes. commit : A snapshot of a repository at some point in time. Instructions Note : There is one set of instructions for both MacOS and Windows. Assume that Enter and Return are interchangable. Note : These steps might be confusing at first because your branch , solution directory , and assignment have the same name, but don't forget that directories and branches are NOT the same thing! (See above). Note : If you receive an error in your terminal, the first thing to check is if you made a typo . You can scroll up in your terminal to see your last command. Take a screenshot or record a screen capture demonstrating your solution if you have not already. Depending on the nature of the assignment, make sure to take a screenshot of the developer console or webpage. Until we reach the HTML and CSS Assignment, most of the time you will be screenshotting the developer console. How to take a screenshot: Mac , Windows Open the Integrated Terminal in VS Code by pressing CTRL + ` OR CMD + J . In the terminal, verify that your prompt ends with the name of your solutions repository. It should look something like this: .../fundamentals-first-solutions-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME (name-of-assignment) $ If your prompt does not say the branch name in the () parentheses, then you skipped a step during the starting-an-assignment guide. Careful! You can fix it now if needed. Otherwise, if the branch name is correct, go to the next step. switch to the main branch of your repository. git switch main Create a new branch for the assignment For example, if your solution is for the example assignment, then run the following command. git branch example switch to the new branch for the assignment For example, if your solution is for the example assignment, then run the following command. git switch example Your terminal prompt should now show the correct branch name in the () parentheses. Stage your solution directory for commit. The git status command should list your solution directory as Untracked or modified . Run the following command to check. git status Stage the solutions by running git add . This is not adding a branch, this is adding ALL untracked files in the repository. git add . Note : Do not forget the . in the command git add . . The . means \"all changed files\", so we are staging all changed files with this command. Double-check the staged files before committing . Your new solution's files should be the only files listed under Changes to be committed: . git status Commit your changes with a meaningful message. If you receive an error message while committing, read it very carefully before asking for help. You might be able to figure out what it means. **If the error requires you to change any of your files, repeat the saving and git add steps above before committing again. For example, if your solution is for the example assignment, then your commit message should be \"Completed example assignment.\" . Note : The quotation marks must match. If your commit appears to get \"stuck\" due to mismatched quotes, press Ctrl + C to cancel. git commit -m \"Completed example assignment\" If the commit succeeds and prints a summary of your added lines of code, then close all open code files in Visual Studio Code. Each file has a tab with an x at the top of the window. Leave VS Code open, but close any code files that you have open. Push the new commit to your repository in GitHub. This will upload your new files. For example, if your solution is for the example assignment, then you will push to the example branch on origin . git push -u origin example You should see a message that says something like: \"Branch example set up to track remote branch example from origin. \u26a0\ufe0f Reminder! Be sure to close open tabs in VS Code before continuing. Open a Pull Request on GitHub by visiting your solutions repository on github.com . Your repository is on your personal profile. Locate the Pull Requests tab near the top of your repository page and click it. Click the New Pull Request button. Set main as the base branch and your assignment branch as the compare branch by clicking the dropdowns. Click the Create Pull Request button. Give your Pull Request a title that makes it easy to identify who it's from and which assignment it's for.

Before you begin \u26a0\ufe0fComplete the Onboarding Guide First\u26a0\ufe0f If you haven't already, you MUST complete the onboarding guide prior to the technology check. Follow the Assignment Start Guide You should have received an example.zip file from your instructor which contains the required files for this exercise. Make sure to follow the starting an exercise guide to begin this exercise. Exercise Instructions Part 1: Inspect the File Structure Most of your assignments will contain the same, or very similar structures as this example assignment. You will have: 1 directory named \"testing\" where you can play around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. This \"testing\" directory will not be reviewed in your Pull Request when you submit an assignment, so feel free to play around with code or test code from our examples. 1 or more directories containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. These directories will be where you complete coding examples and exercises for the assignments. 1 file called quiz.md which contains some basic details and the quiz questions to complete while or after you complete the assignment. Open instructions.md and quiz.md in VS Code. Part 2: Technology Check For this section, we'll be doing a quick technology check to make sure you have everything set up properly. In these instructions, you will be asked to take several screenshots. Make sure to save these screenshots, since you will need to attach them to your Pull Request when submitting the assignment . Open up Google Chrome and head to github.com while logged in to your account and with your profile page open. Take a screenshot of your profile page. Open Terminal (MacOS) or Git Bash (Windows) and run the command below. If you get an error, let your instructor know immediately or send them a message on Discord. After running this command, take a screenshot of the Terminal or Git Bash window with the output. Open the Discord App on your computer and head to the Fundamentals First Server. You should see a category called \" COHORT-XXXX \", which contains a channel called \" discussion \". In the discussion channel, send an introduction message including your name, favorite hobby, and why you want to learn to code. Only your instructor and cohort-mates will see this message. Open your solutions repository in Visual Studio Code , and complete the following: Verify that you see a \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f symbol at the bottom left corner instead of a \u2699\ufe0f symbol.

It lets you run one code block if an if condition is true, or another code block if the if condition is false if condition an expression that evaluates to truthy or falsy, used to determine if a code block will be executed afterwards or not. if( skyColor === \"blue\") code block code between a { and } . One place where these are used are after an if condition, where a code block is executed if the preceding condition was truthy. if( skyColor === \"blue\") { console.log(\"no rain today\"); } && (AND) logical operator performs an AND operation between two boolean expressions and returns either true or false || (OR) logical operator performs an OR operation between two boolean expressions and returns either true or false ! (NOT) logical operator performs a NOT operation on a boolean expression and inverts it Conditional Logic Assignment Conditionals and Prompts Background Most programs are designed to perform different actions based on data. These \"conditional\" actions can be defined by if...else statements . The general format of these statements look like this: if ( FIRST CONDITION ) { FIRST CODE BLOCK } else if ( SECOND CONDITION ) { SECOND CODE BLOCK } else { DEFAULT CODE BLOCK IF ALL ABOVE CONDITIONS ARE FALSE } Each if or else if expression is made up of 2 parts: The if condition: The condition will contain a value or expression that evaluates to a boolean value. Often times, this will contain comparison or equality operators. The code block: Each if condition is associated with a code block, enclosed by curly braces {} . IMPORTANT: only one condition in an if...else block will be executed when your program runs. Even if multiple conditions are true, only the FIRST condition that returns true will execute its associated code block. ALSO IMPORTANT: notice that the else section is different because it doesn't include an associated condition. This is because the else clause acts like a \"catch-all\" so that when none of the conditions are true, the else code block will be executed. Let's take a look at an example. This code snippet will make one of 3 animal sounds based on the animal variable: let animal = \"cat\"; if (animal === \"dog\"){ console.log(\"WOOF!\"); } else if (animal === \"cat\"){ console.log(\"MEOW!\"); } else { console.log(\"...oink?\"); } Since we set the animal variable to \"cat\" this time, we're going to only see \"MEOW!\" on the console. If we had set the animal variable to \"frog\", there's no condition that matches \"frog\" , so the else clause would execute as the \"catch-all\" or default, and we'd see \"...oink?\" logged to the console. Prompts Sometimes, we will want to ask for input from the user instead of hard-coding data into our programs. To get input from the user, we can use the prompt() function. The prompt() function takes a question in the form of a string , which we provide between the parentheses () , just like the console.log() function. Generally, we want to capture the user's response to a prompt, and we can do this by assigning the prompt call to a variable like this: let answer = prompt(\"Hi. What is your name?\"); console.log(\"Hello \" + answer + \"!\"); If the user responds with \"Bill\", then our console would log \"Hello Bill!\" in this case. Note: Prompts will ALWAYS return a string value for the user's answer, so sometimes if you want a number value, you would need to call parseInt to convert the string to a number. Combining this with what we know about conditional logic , we can now execute different code based on a user's input: // Prompt the user to enter their age let age = prompt(\"Please enter your age:\"); // Convert the input to a number age = parseInt(age); // Check the age and log the appropriate message if (age >= 65) { console.log(\"You are a senior.\"); } else if (age >= 18) { console.log(\"You are an adult.\"); } else { console.log(\"You are a minor.\"); } In the above example, we store the user's response in age , and then convert age to a number using parseInt with the next code statement. Then, based on the age of the user, we print whether they are a senior , adult , or minor . Note: Notice how we convert age to a number type using parseInt in this example, since prompt() will by default return a string type. Note: Try running this code and inputting 70 to the prompt. What do you see in the console? Although the number 70 is both greater than or equal to 65 and greater than or equal to 18 , you only see \"You are a senior.\" in the output because only the FIRST true condition executes it's code block. Conditional Logic Exercise Logical Operators Background Often times in our code, we will want to take an action based on more than one boolean condition. We can accomplish this by using Logical Operators . AND Operator For example, we can guess what type of animal we've encountered based on a combination of how many feet it stands on AND whether or not it can jump high. The logical AND ( && ) operator can help us here. Let's start by asking the user a question and storing their response. let twoFeetAnswer = prompt(\"Does this animal usually stand on two feet? Enter true or false\"); let standsOnTwoFeet = (twoFeetAnswer === \"true\"); standsOnTwoFeet will be a boolean with the value of true if the user's string response was \"true\" and false otherwise. Now, let's add a second question. let twoFeetAnswer = prompt(\"Does this animal usually stand on two feet? Enter true or false\"); let standsOnTwoFeet = (twoFeetAnswer === \"true\"); let jumpAnswer = prompt(\"Can this animal jump high? Enter true of false\"); let canItJumpHigh = (jumpAnswer === \"true\"); After the user responds to these prompts, we'll have two boolean values. If we use the && operator on these two values, we'll get a boolean result. The table below diagrams all the possibilities, as well as the what the result of performing a logical AND would give us. standsOnTwoFeet canItJumpHigh standsOnTwoFeet && canItJumpHigh true true true true false false false true false false false false As we can see in the table, we will only get a value of true for standsOnTwoFeet && canItJumpHigh if both of these variable are true . Knowing this, let's extend our code a bit. let twoFeetAnswer = prompt(\"Does this animal usually stand on two feet? Enter true or false\"); let standsOnTwoFeet = (twoFeetAnswer === \"true\"); let jumpAnswer = prompt(\"Can this animal jump high? Enter true of false\"); let canItJumpHigh = (jumpAnswer === \"true\"); if (standsOnTwoFeet && canItJumpHigh){ console.log(\"This might be a KANGAROO!\"); } else { console.log(\"This is definitely not a kangaroo.\"); } Using conditional logic, we're able to make an educated guess! But, what if we wanted to make this a bit more sophisticated? NOT Operator The NOT operator takes the form of ! in code, and it works slightly different than the AND operator, because it's used on only a single value at a time. For example, if we wanted to only concern ourselves with animals that do NOT stand on two feet, we could make another boolean value like this: let doesNotStandOnTwoFeet = !standsOnTwoFeet; Here is a table that shows possibilities of what doesNotStandOnTwoFeet will be, based on what standsOnTwoFeet is to start with. standsOnTwoFeet !standsOnTwoFeet true false false true The NOT operator just \"flips\" the boolean value to the opposite of what it was before. So, here's a version of our program that is now a bit more sophisticated: let twoFeetAnswer = prompt(\"Does this animal usually stand on two feet? Enter true or false\"); let standsOnTwoFeet = (twoFeetAnswer === \"true\"); let jumpAnswer = prompt(\"Can this animal jump high? Enter true of false\"); let canItJumpHigh = (jumpAnswer === \"true\"); let doesNotStandOnTwoFeet = !standsOnTwoFeet; if (standsOnTwoFeet && canItJumpHigh) { console.log(\"This might be a KANGAROO!\"); } else if (doesNotStandOnTwoFeet && canItJumpHigh) { console.log(\"This might be a FROG!\"); } else { console.log(\"This is definitely not a frog or a kangaroo.\"); } OR Operator The third and final logical operator we'll cover is the logical OR operator. Like the AND operatir, it requires two values, and it gives us a true value if at least one of the input values is true. The OR operator takes the form of || in our code. Let's imagine we wanted to write a slightly different program that would tell us whether or not an animal could jump high, based on the name of the animal: let animal = prompt(\"What is the name of your animal?\"); let isKangaroo = (animal === \"kangaroo\"); let isFrog = (animal === \"frog\"); if (isKangaroo || isFrog){ console.log(\"Your animal can definitely jump high!\"); } else { console.log(\"I am not sure if this animal can jump high or not.\"); } Here is a table showing all of the possibilities: isKangaroo isFrog isKangaroo OR isFrog true true true true false true false true true false false false As you can see, we'll get a value of true for isKangaroo || isFrog as long as at least one of the input values is true. Truth Table The rules for these 3 boolean operators are often described in a standard Truth Table . In this table, simply consider p and q to be two boolean values. p q !p p OR q p AND q true true false true true true false false true false false true true true false false false true false false Complete the Logical Operators and Prompts Exercise before moving forward. Logical Operators and Prompts Exercise Truth Table Exercise Fill in the blanks in the following truth table yourself. Note: Operations in parentheses have priority, so they should be evaluated first, and then the final result should come from combining the inner results. p q !p p OR q p AND q (!p) OR (p AND q) true true ? true true ? true false false ? false ? false true true true ? ? false false true ? false ?

These \"conditional\" actions can be defined by if...else statements . The general format of these statements look like this: if ( FIRST CONDITION ) { FIRST CODE BLOCK } else if ( SECOND CONDITION ) { SECOND CODE BLOCK } else { DEFAULT CODE BLOCK IF ALL ABOVE CONDITIONS ARE FALSE } Each if or else if expression is made up of 2 parts: The if condition: The condition will contain a value or expression that evaluates to a boolean value. Often times, this will contain comparison or equality operators. The code block: Each if condition is associated with a code block, enclosed by curly braces {} . IMPORTANT: only one condition in an if...else block will be executed when your program runs. Even if multiple conditions are true, only the FIRST condition that returns true will execute its associated code block. ALSO IMPORTANT: notice that the else section is different because it doesn't include an associated condition. This is because the else clause acts like a \"catch-all\" so that when none of the conditions are true, the else code block will be executed. Let's take a look at an example. This code snippet will make one of 3 animal sounds based on the animal variable: let animal = \"cat\"; if (animal === \"dog\"){ console.log(\"WOOF!\"); } else if (animal === \"cat\"){ console.log(\"MEOW!\"); } else { console.log(\"...oink?\"); } Since we set the animal variable to \"cat\" this time, we're going to only see \"MEOW!\" on the console. If we had set the animal variable to \"frog\", there's no condition that matches \"frog\" , so the else clause would execute as the \"catch-all\" or default, and we'd see \"...oink?\" logged to the console.","title":"Conditionals and Prompts Background"},{"location":"unit-1/conditional-logic/#prompts","text":"Sometimes, we will want to ask for input from the user instead of hard-coding data into our programs. To get input from the user, we can use the prompt() function. The prompt() function takes a question in the form of a string , which we provide between the parentheses () , just like the console.log() function. Generally, we want to capture the user's response to a prompt, and we can do this by assigning the prompt call to a variable like this: let answer = prompt(\"Hi. What is your name?\"); console.log(\"Hello \" + answer + \"!\"); If the user responds with \"Bill\", then our console would log \"Hello Bill!\" in this case. Note: Prompts will ALWAYS return a string value for the user's answer, so sometimes if you want a number value, you would need to call parseInt to convert the string to a number. Combining this with what we know about conditional logic , we can now execute different code based on a user's input: // Prompt the user to enter their age let age = prompt(\"Please enter your age:\"); // Convert the input to a number age = parseInt(age); // Check the age and log the appropriate message if (age >= 65) { console.log(\"You are a senior.\"); } else if (age >= 18) { console.log(\"You are an adult.\"); } else { console.log(\"You are a minor.\"); } In the above example, we store the user's response in age , and then convert age to a number using parseInt with the next code statement. Then, based on the age of the user, we print whether they are a senior , adult , or minor . Note: Notice how we convert age to a number type using parseInt in this example, since prompt() will by default return a string type. Note: Try running this code and inputting 70 to the prompt. What do you see in the console? Although the number 70 is both greater than or equal to 65 and greater than or equal to 18 , you only see \"You are a senior.\" in the output because only the FIRST true condition executes it's code block.","title":"Prompts"},{"location":"unit-1/conditional-logic/#conditional-logic-exercise","text":"","title":"Conditional Logic Exercise"},{"location":"unit-1/conditional-logic/#logical-operators-background","text":"Often times in our code, we will want to take an action based on more than one boolean condition.

The logical AND ( && ) operator can help us here. Let's start by asking the user a question and storing their response. let twoFeetAnswer = prompt(\"Does this animal usually stand on two feet? Enter true or false\"); let standsOnTwoFeet = (twoFeetAnswer === \"true\"); standsOnTwoFeet will be a boolean with the value of true if the user's string response was \"true\" and false otherwise. Now, let's add a second question. let twoFeetAnswer = prompt(\"Does this animal usually stand on two feet? Enter true or false\"); let standsOnTwoFeet = (twoFeetAnswer === \"true\"); let jumpAnswer = prompt(\"Can this animal jump high? Enter true of false\"); let canItJumpHigh = (jumpAnswer === \"true\"); After the user responds to these prompts, we'll have two boolean values. If we use the && operator on these two values, we'll get a boolean result. The table below diagrams all the possibilities, as well as the what the result of performing a logical AND would give us. standsOnTwoFeet canItJumpHigh standsOnTwoFeet && canItJumpHigh true true true true false false false true false false false false As we can see in the table, we will only get a value of true for standsOnTwoFeet && canItJumpHigh if both of these variable are true . Knowing this, let's extend our code a bit. let twoFeetAnswer = prompt(\"Does this animal usually stand on two feet? Enter true or false\"); let standsOnTwoFeet = (twoFeetAnswer === \"true\"); let jumpAnswer = prompt(\"Can this animal jump high? Enter true of false\"); let canItJumpHigh = (jumpAnswer === \"true\"); if (standsOnTwoFeet && canItJumpHigh){ console.log(\"This might be a KANGAROO!\"); } else { console.log(\"This is definitely not a kangaroo.\"); } Using conditional logic, we're able to make an educated guess!

So, here's a version of our program that is now a bit more sophisticated: let twoFeetAnswer = prompt(\"Does this animal usually stand on two feet? Enter true or false\"); let standsOnTwoFeet = (twoFeetAnswer === \"true\"); let jumpAnswer = prompt(\"Can this animal jump high? Enter true of false\"); let canItJumpHigh = (jumpAnswer === \"true\"); let doesNotStandOnTwoFeet = !standsOnTwoFeet; if (standsOnTwoFeet && canItJumpHigh) { console.log(\"This might be a KANGAROO!\"); } else if (doesNotStandOnTwoFeet && canItJumpHigh) { console.log(\"This might be a FROG!\"); } else { console.log(\"This is definitely not a frog or a kangaroo.\"); }","title":"NOT Operator"},{"location":"unit-1/conditional-logic/#or-operator","text":"The third and final logical operator we'll cover is the logical OR operator.

These include numbers, strings (text), booleans (condition), null (nothing), or undefined (no value set) Variables and Data Assignment In this assignment, we'll go over the basics of variables and data types in JavaScript Variables and Data Values Background A variable is a label you can reference in your code that points to a value. In this first set of examples all of our values are going to be strings. We'll talk more about strings shortly, but for now just know that strings are sets of characters contained by quotes. \"Hello World\" You can shoose just about any name you like for variables in your program by declaring them. For example, you could declare a variable called firstName like this: let firstName; All we're doing here is: \"a variable called firstName now exists\" in the program. Rules and Conventions for variable naming: The first character must be a letter or underscore( _ ) variable names can not contain spaces, symbols, or punctuation marks variable names are case sensitive; variables can not be named certain \"reserved keywords\" that are a part of the JavaScript language, such as \"let\", \"for\", or \"if\" the convention for naming variables is to use camelCase , which means the first letter of the first word in the variable is lowercase , and any following words are capitalized After you have declared a variable, you can assign it to any value you'd like by using the = operator. let firstName; firstName = \"Allan\"; The above example declares the variable on the first line and assigns it to the value \"Allan\" on the second line. The declaration and assignment can also be done together in a single line: let firstName = \"Allan\"; If we were to now console.log the variable called \"firstName\", our output would say \"Allan\" let firstName = \"Allan\"; // This will log \"Allan\" to the console console.log(firstName); Using console.log() is a handy way to \"look into\" our program and see what values our variables are holding while the program is running. You'll be using this trick a lot. Note: You only need to use the let reserved keyword when you are initially declaring a variable. After a variable has been declared, you can re-assign it to a different value at any point and no longer need to use the let keyword. // Declares firstName and assigns it to \"Allan\" let firstName = \"Allan\"; // Logs \"Allan\" console.log(firstName); // Re-assigns firstName to \"Chris\" firstName = \"Chris\"; // Logs \"Chris\" now console.log(firstName); Now, complete the Values and Variables Exercise before moving forward. Values and Variables Exercise Strings and Numbers Background Every value in JavaScript has an associated data type. You can see a value's type by using the typeof operator like this. console.log(typoef \"Hello World\"); // logs \"string\" So far, all the values we've worked with have been of the type string . Strings are great when we want to keep track of text as values, but what about when we're dealing with numbers? let x = \"10\"; let y = \"3\"; console.log(x + y); // logs \"103\" You might expect the program above to log 13 , but it actually logs \"103\" . This is because the variables x and y point to string values, which we've indicated with the quotes \"\" . For string values, using the + operator between them will simply combine them together like two words. In programming, this is called string concatenation . IF we want to actually treat these two values like numbers, we need to remove the quotes: let x = 10; let y = 3; console.log(x + y); // logs 13 console.log(x - y); // logs 7 console.log(x * y); // logs 30 console.log(x / y); // logs 3.333333... console.log(x % y); // logs 1 console.log(x ** y) // logs 1000 The symbols between x and y above are called operators . The full statements x + y or x / y are called expressions , which calculate to a value when they are evaluated . Specifically, the ones I used above are called arithmetic operators , since they do math operations. Here's a table of all the arithmetic operators in JavaScript and what they do: Operator Description Usage + Addition : Adds two numbers or concatenates two strings x + y - Subtraction : Subtracts the second number from the first x - y * Multiplication : Multiplies two numbers x * y / Division : Divides the first number by the second x / y % Modulus : Calculates the remainder when the first number is divided by the second x % y ** Exponentiation : Takes the first number to the power of the second number x ** y ++ Increment : Adds 1 to a number x++ -- Decrement : Subtracts 1 from a number y-- Sometimes you will need to convert a value from one type to another. For example, consider the below example: let age = \"60\"; let laterAge = age + 4; console.log(\"In 4 years, you will be \" + laterAge); This program would log a statement that says \"In 4 years, you will be 604\" Clearly, this is not what we intended here. If we want JavaScript to actually add our two numbers, we need to convert our string to a number using the parseInt() function like this: let age = \"60\"; let laterAge = parseInt(age) + 4; console.log(\"In 4 years, you will be \" + laterAge); This time, we log the correct statement that says \"In 4 years, you will be 64\" Complete the Strings and Numbers Exercise before moving forward. Strings and Numbers Exercise (want to introduce toUpperCase, toLowerCase) Booleans and Comparison Operators Background A 3rd type we haven't discussed yet is the boolean . A boolean type represents a condition of some sort, like whether it's raining outside, or whether a number is even. A boolean data type can only hold one of two values: true or false . We can assign a variable to a boolean like this: let isRaining = true; let is Snowing = false; Note: We do NOT use quotations like we do with strings. Booleans are often used to describe \"binary\" states of being, meaning there are only two possible choices. Either it is raining, or it is not at any given moment. Either a number is even, or it is odd. Comparison operators are symbols that are used for comparing two values, and they evaluate , or calculate, to boolean values. Here's a partial list, assuming that x = 5 : Operator Description Comparing Returns == equal to x == 8 false x == 5 true x == \"5\" true === equal value and equal type x === 5 true x === \"5\" false != not equal to x != 8 true !== not equal value OR not equal type x !== 5 false x !== \"5\" true x !== 8 true > greater than x > 8 false < less than x < 8 true >= greater than or equal to x >= 8 false <= less than or equal to x <= 8 true Note : Notice that === has a completely different meaning from = by itself. === is a comparison operator that evaluates to true or false based on if two values are exactly equal, while = is used for assignment to a variable only, as you've seen so far. IMPORTANT : Take note of the difference between == and === . == checks just the data value, whereas === checks both the data type and the data value. For our course, and when you code beyond this course, it's recommended to ONLY USE THE === operator. It's much safer and more precise to use. Using these comparison operators, we can define boolean variables like this: let x = 1; let y = 2; let areEqual = (x === y); console.log(areEqual); // false let xGreater = (x > y); console.log(areEqual); // false let xLesser = (x < y); console.log(areEqual); // true Booleans also concatenate onto strings just like numbers do: let isFriday = false; console.log(\"Is today Friday? \" + isFriday); // Logs \"Is today Friday? false\" Complete the Booleans and Comparison Operators Exercise before moving forward. Booleans and Comparison Operators Exercise Null and Undefined Background There are 2 more data types that we will go over today: null and undefined . Both of these data types have only one associated value, null , and undefined , respectively. These two data types are often confused with one another, since they mean close to the same thing, but not exactly. null represents nothing or an empty value. It is used when we want to specifically assign the value \"nothing\" to a variable. For example, this is how you would use null to represent someone with no middle name: let middleName = null; console.log(middleName); // Logs \"null undefined represents a data value that hasn't been set yet or doesn't exist.

You ask the librarian where the book you're looking for is, and he points you to a spot in the back of the library. When you get there, you see a book in the spot that the librarian pointed you to. You pick it up, open it, and realize that the book is empty. There's no title, no table of contents, and it's filled with empty pages. This is like the null data type. There's a book there, but it's clearly been filled with nothing on purpose. Now, let's say that when you get to where the book is supposed to be, you see that the shelf is empty. There's no book. You can see that there is supposed to be a book there, but there's no book in sight. You can't be sure what happened to the book. Did someone check it out already? Will it be returned later? Did it never exist in the first place? This is more like undefined . There's no book at all, and you can't be sure if it was on purpose or not. Answer the questions in quiz.md about null and undefined . Primitive Data Types In the above sections, we discussed 5 different data types: string , number , boolean , null , and undefined . These are known as JavaScript's primitive data types . There are also 3 more data types known as reference data types , which we will discuss in our later assignments.

In this first set of examples all of our values are going to be strings. We'll talk more about strings shortly, but for now just know that strings are sets of characters contained by quotes. \"Hello World\" You can shoose just about any name you like for variables in your program by declaring them. For example, you could declare a variable called firstName like this: let firstName; All we're doing here is: \"a variable called firstName now exists\" in the program. Rules and Conventions for variable naming: The first character must be a letter or underscore( _ ) variable names can not contain spaces, symbols, or punctuation marks variable names are case sensitive; variables can not be named certain \"reserved keywords\" that are a part of the JavaScript language, such as \"let\", \"for\", or \"if\" the convention for naming variables is to use camelCase , which means the first letter of the first word in the variable is lowercase , and any following words are capitalized After you have declared a variable, you can assign it to any value you'd like by using the = operator. let firstName; firstName = \"Allan\"; The above example declares the variable on the first line and assigns it to the value \"Allan\" on the second line. The declaration and assignment can also be done together in a single line: let firstName = \"Allan\"; If we were to now console.log the variable called \"firstName\", our output would say \"Allan\" let firstName = \"Allan\"; // This will log \"Allan\" to the console console.log(firstName); Using console.log() is a handy way to \"look into\" our program and see what values our variables are holding while the program is running. You'll be using this trick a lot. Note: You only need to use the let reserved keyword when you are initially declaring a variable. After a variable has been declared, you can re-assign it to a different value at any point and no longer need to use the let keyword. // Declares firstName and assigns it to \"Allan\" let firstName = \"Allan\"; // Logs \"Allan\" console.log(firstName); // Re-assigns firstName to \"Chris\" firstName = \"Chris\"; // Logs \"Chris\" now console.log(firstName); Now, complete the Values and Variables Exercise before moving forward.","title":"Variables and Data Values Background"},{"location":"unit-1/variables-and-data/#values-and-variables-exercise","text":"","title":"Values and Variables Exercise"},{"location":"unit-1/variables-and-data/#strings-and-numbers-background","text":"Every value in JavaScript has an associated data type. You can see a value's type by using the typeof operator like this. console.log(typoef \"Hello World\"); // logs \"string\" So far, all the values we've worked with have been of the type string . Strings are great when we want to keep track of text as values, but what about when we're dealing with numbers? let x = \"10\"; let y = \"3\"; console.log(x + y); // logs \"103\" You might expect the program above to log 13 , but it actually logs \"103\" . This is because the variables x and y point to string values, which we've indicated with the quotes \"\" . For string values, using the + operator between them will simply combine them together like two words. In programming, this is called string concatenation . IF we want to actually treat these two values like numbers, we need to remove the quotes: let x = 10; let y = 3; console.log(x + y); // logs 13 console.log(x - y); // logs 7 console.log(x * y); // logs 30 console.log(x / y); // logs 3.333333... console.log(x % y); // logs 1 console.log(x ** y) // logs 1000 The symbols between x and y above are called operators . The full statements x + y or x / y are called expressions , which calculate to a value when they are evaluated . Specifically, the ones I used above are called arithmetic operators , since they do math operations. Here's a table of all the arithmetic operators in JavaScript and what they do: Operator Description Usage + Addition : Adds two numbers or concatenates two strings x + y - Subtraction : Subtracts the second number from the first x - y * Multiplication : Multiplies two numbers x * y / Division : Divides the first number by the second x / y % Modulus : Calculates the remainder when the first number is divided by the second x % y ** Exponentiation : Takes the first number to the power of the second number x ** y ++ Increment : Adds 1 to a number x++ -- Decrement : Subtracts 1 from a number y-- Sometimes you will need to convert a value from one type to another. For example, consider the below example: let age = \"60\"; let laterAge = age + 4; console.log(\"In 4 years, you will be \" + laterAge); This program would log a statement that says \"In 4 years, you will be 604\" Clearly, this is not what we intended here. If we want JavaScript to actually add our two numbers, we need to convert our string to a number using the parseInt() function like this: let age = \"60\"; let laterAge = parseInt(age) + 4; console.log(\"In 4 years, you will be \" + laterAge); This time, we log the correct statement that says \"In 4 years, you will be 64\" Complete the Strings and Numbers Exercise before moving forward.","title":"Strings and Numbers Background"},{"location":"unit-1/variables-and-data/#strings-and-numbers-exercise","text":"(want to introduce toUpperCase, toLowerCase)","title":"Strings and Numbers Exercise"},{"location":"unit-1/variables-and-data/#booleans-and-comparison-operators-background","text":"A 3rd type we haven't discussed yet is the boolean . A boolean type represents a condition of some sort, like whether it's raining outside, or whether a number is even. A boolean data type can only hold one of two values: true or false . We can assign a variable to a boolean like this: let isRaining = true; let is Snowing = false; Note: We do NOT use quotations like we do with strings. Booleans are often used to describe \"binary\" states of being, meaning there are only two possible choices. Either it is raining, or it is not at any given moment. Either a number is even, or it is odd. Comparison operators are symbols that are used for comparing two values, and they evaluate , or calculate, to boolean values. Here's a partial list, assuming that x = 5 : Operator Description Comparing Returns == equal to x == 8 false x == 5 true x == \"5\" true === equal value and equal type x === 5 true x === \"5\" false != not equal to x != 8 true !== not equal value OR not equal type x !== 5 false x !== \"5\" true x !== 8 true > greater than x > 8 false < less than x < 8 true >= greater than or equal to x >= 8 false <= less than or equal to x <= 8 true Note : Notice that === has a completely different meaning from = by itself. === is a comparison operator that evaluates to true or false based on if two values are exactly equal, while = is used for assignment to a variable only, as you've seen so far. IMPORTANT : Take note of the difference between == and === . == checks just the data value, whereas === checks both the data type and the data value. For our course, and when you code beyond this course, it's recommended to ONLY USE THE === operator. It's much safer and more precise to use. Using these comparison operators, we can define boolean variables like this: let x = 1; let y = 2; let areEqual = (x === y); console.log(areEqual); // false let xGreater = (x > y); console.log(areEqual); // false let xLesser = (x < y); console.log(areEqual); // true Booleans also concatenate onto strings just like numbers do: let isFriday = false; console.log(\"Is today Friday? \" + isFriday); // Logs \"Is today Friday? false\" Complete the Booleans and Comparison Operators Exercise before moving forward.","title":"Booleans and Comparison Operators Background"},{"location":"unit-1/variables-and-data/#booleans-and-comparison-operators-exercise","text":"","title":"Booleans and Comparison Operators Exercise"},{"location":"unit-1/variables-and-data/#null-and-undefined-background","text":"There are 2 more data types that we will go over today: null and undefined .

Arrays Background Arrays are used for storing ordered lists of items . Initializing This will create an array of three restaurants. let restaurants = [\"State Bird\", \"House of Prime Rib\", \"McDonalds\"]; Length To see how many items are in an array, we can use the length property. let restaurants = [\"State Bird\", \"House of Prime Rib\", \"McDonalds\"]; console.log(restaurants.length); Accessing Every item in an array has an index it can be accessed at. The first item is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and the third is at index 2. You can access an item by index using square brackets . let restaurants = [\"State Bird\", \"House of Prime Rib\", \"McDonalds\"]; console.log(\"first item: \" + restaurants[0]); console.log(\"second item: \" + restaurants[1]); Changing Items We can also use square brackets to update an item in an array. let restaurants = [\"State Bird\", \"House of Prime Rib\", \"McDonalds\"]; restaurants[0] = \"Burger King\"; console.log(\"first item: \" + restaurants[0]); The first item has been changed to \"Burger King\" (sorry, foodies). Array Documentation and Methods Background After doing some coding, you'll start to notice that many times you are performing the same tasks in your programs. Languages try to make your life easier by packaging these common tasks into functions or methods you can then use in your programs. You've already used at least two built-in functions already: console.log() and prompt() You also may have already noticed that when you are using ( invoking ) functions, parentheses are part of the syntax, and sometimes you put provide data between the parentheses as an input ( argument ) to the function. But how do you know if there is already a built-in function for what you want to do? The best way is to start getting comfortable reading the language documentation. For JavaScript, Mozilla Developer Network ( MDN ) is going to be your best resource. Let's take a look at two functions from the documentation that work specifically for arrays. push() push() is a convenient way add a single item to the end of an array. As the documentation shows, it must be called on an existing array (not out in the open like you can with console.log() or prompt()). let fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\"]; fruits.push(\"Mango\"); console.log(fruits); Previously, we had an array of two items. By calling fruits.push(\"Mango\"), we have added a third item to the end of the array. pop() pop() is the opposite of push(). Instead of adding a new item, pop() will remove the top item from the array. Note that push() and pop() will both actually modify the array you invoke them on. When a function modifies the object it's used on, we say that this is a mutating function . let fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\"]; fruits.pop(); console.log(fruits); console.log(fruits.length); After running the code above, the mutated fruits array now has only 1 item left in it. In addition to mutating the array, you can also capture the result of the pop() function and assign it to a variable. let fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\"]; let poppedItem = fruits.pop(); console.log(poppedItem); The value that a function gives you back (in this case, the popped item), is referred to as that function's return value.

For Loop Background Computers are really good at handling our repetitive tasks for us. One of the most common ways to tell JavaScript to do something for us several times is to use a For Loop. Here's an example for loop that will count up from 1 to 100 and log each number: for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) { console.log(i); } console.log(\"whew!\"); The top of the For Loop is composed of three parts separated by semicolons (NOT commas!) that you will customize based on the behavior you want. for ( INITIALIZATION; CONDITION; INCREMENTING STATEMENT ) INITIALIZATION : Where do we start? This is normally where you'll declare a new variable to use in the loop, and you'll also assign it an initial value. The initialization runs only once at the very beginning of the loop. CONDITION : When do we stop looping? This condition is checked after each iteration to determine whether or not to loop again. Once the condition is no longer true, the loop is finished and JavaScript will move on to the next statement in your program. INCREMENTING STATEMENT : What should be done after each iteration of the loop? Should we increment a variable? Should we decrease it by 2? This section runs after every iteration. Iterating over Arrays Background Arrays and for loops are often used together so we can perform the same operations to every item in the array. This process of looping over arrays is called iteration . Here's an example of how we might iterate over an array of pet names and \"yell\" each one. let petNames = [\"Fluffy\", \"Fido\", \"Iggy\"]; for ( let i=0; i < petNames.length; i++ ){ let currentPetName = petNames[i]; console.log(currentPetName.toUpperCase()); } Notice above that we're using petNames[i] to access the current petName . This works because the value of i will start at 0 and increase by 1 with each iteration. For example, on the first loop i will be 0 , so petNames[i] becomes petNames[0] , which will give us \"Fluffy\" . Complete the Loops and Iteration Exercise before continuing.

For example, on the first loop i will be 0 , so petNames[i] becomes petNames[0] , which will give us \"Fluffy\" .

You can imagine a function as a box with two holes on opposing sides. The first hole in the box is for accepting an input of some kind. In the example above, our input is a number. On the other side of the box, we get an output based on our input. In this case, our input was the number 3, so our output was the number 9, since this function's job is simply to square our input. Built-in functions JavaScript comes with many common functions already built for you. For example, Math.round() is a function that: Accepts a decimal number as an input Returns an rounded integer as an output Let's try using it for a few values. let result = Math.round(5.333); console.log(result); // 5 result = Math.round(7.89); console.log(result); // 8 Can you think of other built-in functions you've already used? (Hint: One of them is used in the example above) Writing our own function Let's write our own function for squaring a number like in the image at the top. function square(x){ let output = x * x; return output; } There are a few very important terms to classify: \"square\" is the function name x is our input for the function, which is formally called a parameter The return statement is where we say return ___; Whatever the ___ is will be the output of our function. In this case, we are returning/outputting the square of x . Invoking a function If you just paste in the above function to a program and run it, you won't see any result. This is because all we have done so far is written the function definition . Defining a function is like writing a recipe: it doesn't give you anything to chew on until you actually \"use\" it! We use our functions by invoking them. Here is a program that invokes our square function 3 times and logs each result. function square(x){ let output = x * x; return output; } let result = square(5); console.log(result); // 25 console.log(square(6)); // 36 console.log(square(7)); // 49 Try running the above code, and notice that the three separate results logged to the screen. Returning from a Function Whenever we reach a return statement inside of a function, a function will stop executing immediately. return statements are instructions to \"immediately stop the function and return this value\". It's important to remember this because you don't want to be adding any code statements after writing a return statement. function square(x){ let output = x * x; return output; console.log(\"The output is \" + output); // This line of code will never run } Why functions? Our example above is a short two-line function, but often in the real world, functions will invoke other functions that will perform complex calculations and potentially execute thousands of lines of code. For example, if we were writing the code for Amazon, we might have a function called processPayment() . Amazon needs to process payments in many different contexts, but by having a function that wraps this functionality, it's like a magic \"black box\" that can be do it all for us by simply invoking it. Being able to perform complex sequences of activities by simple invoking a function allows us to avoid repeating ourselves. Not repeating yourself is such an important part of writing good code that there's a popular acronym called DRY that programmers are taught to follow. DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself . Processing Arrays with Functions Functions can accept any type of value as a parameter. Depending on what we need, we might write a function that accepts a number, a string, an object, or even an array as an argument. Once you're \"inside\" the function, remember that you can treat your parameters exactly like you would any other variable. Suppose we are tasked with writing a function that accepts an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all those numbers. Our solution might look like the following: function addAll(numbersArray){ // We'll use this variable to keep track of the total as we add everything. let total = 0; // Add each number in the array to the total for (let i = 0; i < numbersArray.length; i++){ total = total + numbersArray[i]; } // Return the total we've built up at the end. return total; } split() function for Strings split() is a handy built-in function you can use to divide a single string up into an array of strings. We can learn the details by reading the MDN documentation. The easiest way to get there is to Google \"MDN string split\". The first result should lead you here . The split() method splits a string into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings. MDN also tells us we can pass in a separator parameter that specifies what String we want to divide the string based on. Try out each these examples to get a feel for how split() works. let list = \"bread, peanut butter, jelly\".split(\",\"); console.log(list); let newList = \"eggs, avocados, salsa, chorizo\".split(\", \"); console.log(newList); let numberOfWords = \"eggs, avocados, salsa, chorizo\".split(\", \").length; console.log(numberOfWords); let secondWord = \"eggs, avocados, salsa, chorizo\".split(\", \")[1]; console.log(secondWord); let words = \"once upon a time\".split(\" \"); console.log(words); Complete the Functions Exercise before moving forward.

Objects Background Objects in JS are similar to Arrays, except the indexes are strings instead of integers. You can think of JavaScript objects as collections of related data . Initialization The following code will initialize a new object representing a cat. let myAnimal = { name: \"cat\", legs: 4, genus: \"felis\", species: \"catus\", sound: \"meow\" }; The myAnimal object has these five properties (sometimes called keys): name , legs , genus , species , sound . Each property name also has an associated value. For example: The name property is associated with the \"cat\" value. The legs property is associated with the 4 value. Accessing Properties We can look up the value of a particular property in two different ways: dot notation or bracket notation . let myAnimal = { name: \"cat\", legs: 4, genus: \"felis\", species: \"catus\", sound: \"meow\" }; // Dot notation console.log( myAnimal.name ); // \"cat\" // Bracket notation console.log( myAnimal[\"name\"]); // \"cat\" // Also bracket notation var propName = \"genus\"; console.log( myAnimal[propName] ); // \"felis\" Note: when we use bracket notation, we need to use either a string (enclosed in quotes), or a variable that points to a string (not enclosed in quotes). JavaScript syntax does not allow the following. console.log( myAnimal.\"species\" ) // ILLEGAL / ERROR! Updating Properties You can also use dot or bracket notation to add new property-value pairs after the initialization, or to update existing ones. let myAnimal = { name: \"cat\", legs: 4, genus: \"felis\", species: \"catus\", sound: \"meow\" }; // Dot notation myAnimal.personality = \"Strange\"; // Adds a new property myAnimal.sound = \"purr\"; // Updates an existing property // Bracket notation myAnimal[\"tail\"] = true; // Adds a new property console.log( myAnimal ); Objects Exercise Arrays of Objects Background Often times, we want to process a list of similar objects in our program. We can group our objects together by including them all in an array. For example, let's pretend that we're doing some programming for a phone, and we need to keep track of a list of contacts. Here are four properties we might want to track about each contact: firstName lastName phoneNumber momsName (so we can ask about her) Initialization let contacts = [ { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Lennon\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-2222\", momsName: \"Julia\" }, { firstName: \"George\", lastName: \"Harrison\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-3333\", momsName: \"Louise\" }, { firstName: \"Paul\", lastName: \"McCartney\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-4444\", momsName: \"Mary\" }, { firstName: \"Ringo\", lastName: \"Starr\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-5555\", momsName: \"Elsie\" } ]; Adding to arrays of objects Our list of contacts is just like any other array, except it happens to contain objects. To add a new item, we can simply use the push function like we always would. let otherContact = { firstName: \"Pete\", lastName: \"Best\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-2233\", momsName: \"Mona\" }; contacts.push( otherContact ); Iteration and property acccess Suppose now we want to \"text\" each of our contacts and ask about their mothers (since we're a considerate friend). Since our contacts array is just like any other array, we can iterate through our items just like we would with any other array: let contacts = [ { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Lennon\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-2222\", momsName: \"Julia\" }, { firstName: \"George\", lastName: \"Harrison\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-3333\", momsName: \"Louise\" }, { firstName: \"Paul\", lastName: \"McCartney\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-4444\", momsName: \"Mary\" }, { firstName: \"Ringo\", lastName: \"Starr\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-5555\", momsName: \"Elsie\" } ]; let otherContact = { firstName: \"Pete\", lastName: \"Best\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-2233\", momsName: \"Mona\" }; contacts.push( otherContact ); for (let i=0; i<contacts.length; i++){ let currentContact = contacts[i]; console.log(\"Hi \" + currentContact.firstName + \". How is \" + currentContact.momsName + \"?\"); } Please complete the Arrays of Objects Exercise before moving forward. Arrays of Objects Exercise Searching Arrays of Objects Background Let's return to our list of contacts from the previous section. let contacts = [ { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Lennon\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-2222\", momsName: \"Julia\" }, { firstName: \"George\", lastName: \"Harrison\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-3333\", momsName: \"Louise\" }, { firstName: \"Paul\", lastName: \"McCartney\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-4444\", momsName: \"Mary\" }, { firstName: \"Ringo\", lastName: \"Starr\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-5555\", momsName: \"Elsie\" } ]; We have a relatively small list in this example, but in the real world, we might have thousands of contacts. Rather than scrolling through thousands of people, it would more efficient to be able to search for a particular person. Searching is a common coding problem, and we can do it with simple for loop and some conditional logic. let contacts = [ { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Lennon\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-2222\", momsName: \"Julia\" }, { firstName: \"George\", lastName: \"Harrison\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-3333\", momsName: \"Louise\" }, { firstName: \"Paul\", lastName: \"McCartney\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-4444\", momsName: \"Mary\" }, { firstName: \"Ringo\", lastName: \"Starr\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-5555\", momsName: \"Elsie\" } ]; // Collect a search string from a user let searchString = prompt(\"Who do you want to find?\"); // Create a variable to eventually point to the person we want to find. let foundContact = null; // Iterate over contacts for (let i = 0; i < contacts.length; i++){ let currentContact = contacts[i]j; // Check if this contact's firstName matches our search if( currentContact.firstName === searchString ){ foundContact = currentContact; break; } } // We are now outside of our for loop. // if the foundContact variable is still null, we know we have NOT found this person. if (foundContact === null){ console.log(\"No matching record was found for \" + searchString) } else { console.log(\"We found a matching contact:\") console.log(foundContact.firstName + \"'s number is \" + foundContact.phoneNumber) } Note: , you may notice a break; statement in the for loop above. A break; statement ends a loop early. You can read about 2 special reserved keywords break and continue here . Questions for consideration Does capitalization matter in the example above?

Searching is a common coding problem, and we can do it with simple for loop and some conditional logic. let contacts = [ { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Lennon\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-2222\", momsName: \"Julia\" }, { firstName: \"George\", lastName: \"Harrison\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-3333\", momsName: \"Louise\" }, { firstName: \"Paul\", lastName: \"McCartney\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-4444\", momsName: \"Mary\" }, { firstName: \"Ringo\", lastName: \"Starr\", phoneNumber: \"555-777-5555\", momsName: \"Elsie\" } ]; // Collect a search string from a user let searchString = prompt(\"Who do you want to find?\"); // Create a variable to eventually point to the person we want to find. let foundContact = null; // Iterate over contacts for (let i = 0; i < contacts.length; i++){ let currentContact = contacts[i]j; // Check if this contact's firstName matches our search if( currentContact.firstName === searchString ){ foundContact = currentContact; break; } } // We are now outside of our for loop. // if the foundContact variable is still null, we know we have NOT found this person. if (foundContact === null){ console.log(\"No matching record was found for \" + searchString) } else { console.log(\"We found a matching contact:\") console.log(foundContact.firstName + \"'s number is \" + foundContact.phoneNumber) } Note: , you may notice a break; statement in the for loop above. A break; statement ends a loop early. You can read about 2 special reserved keywords break and continue here . Questions for consideration Does capitalization matter in the example above? If so, how can we make it not matter?","title":"Searching Arrays of Objects Background"},{"location":"unit-3/objects/#searching-arrays-of-objects-exercise","text":"","title":"Searching Arrays of Objects Exercise"},{"location":"unit-3/objects/#submitting","text":"Please follow the instructions in submitting an exercise to submit your assignment solution.","title":"Submitting"},{"location":"unit-4/higher-order-programming/","text":"Higher Order Programming Objectives Describe what qualifies a function as \"higher order\" Assign functions to variables Utilize callback functions as arguments to other functions Use forEach() as an alternative to a standard for loop Use anonymous functions Apply the map() function to solve algorithmic problems Key Terms higher order programming treating functions like data; use of functions that include functions as parameters function expression a way to define a function and assign it to a variable let greet = function(name) { console.log(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\"); }; callback a function provided as an argument to another function; will be invoked at a future point in time, often after a specific action has been performed forEach() higher order array method for iterating over items and invoking a common function for each item in the array let people = [ 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Candice']; let greetFunction = function(person) { console.log('Hi ' + person); } people.forEach(greetFunction); map() higher order array method that returns a new array with each item transformed by a provided transformation function let people = [ 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Candice']; let capitalizer = function(person) { return person.toUpperCase(); } let capitalizedPeople = people.map(capitalizer) // ['ALICE', 'BOB', 'CANDICE']; Higher Order Programming Assignment Higher Order Programming Background Recall that a function is simply a block of code. // Definition function doubleIt(num){ return num * 2; } It can optionally accept some parameters, and it returns a value when we invoke it. // Invocation doubleIt(2); // returns 4 Up to this point, there has been a clear distinction between our functions and our data.

This syntax is called a Function Expression . Array.forEach() We won't go into all of the possible ways we can use Higher Order Programming in our code, but one of the most common places to use higher order programming is with arrays. Let's pretend we're a bit of a cat hoarder, so decide it's best to store our entire collection of cats in an array. let cats = [\"Sylvester\", \"Tigger\", \"Mr. Bigglesworth\", \"Felix\", \"Simba\"]; When it's dinner time, we need to yell for each of our kitties by name. Up to now, the way we might handle this is with a standard for loop: let cats = [\"Sylvester\", \"Tigger\", \"Mr. Bigglesworth\", \"Felix\", \"Simba\"]; for (let i =0; i < cats.length; i++){ console.log(cats[i].toUpperCase() + \", IT'S DINNER TIME!\"); } This solution will certainly get the job done. For loops like this are hopefully becoming second nature to us by now, but there are a few details that make our code a bit \"wordy\". When we're reading this code, we have to manage the i counter ourselves. It's a bit distracting to look at. Whenever we are referencing the current cat with an iteration, we have to constantly remind ourselves that we're inside of a loop, and we need to use our counter to say cats[i] . Needing to \"process\" every item in an array is so common that JavaScript includes a built-in function called forEach to make this easier for you. forEach is a higher order function that requires a single parameter called a callback function . The callback function works like a \"hint\" to forEach to tell it how to process a SINGLE item. In our case, we might use a function like this one to describe how to process a single cat. let forOne = function(cat){ console.log(cat.toUpperCase() + \", IT'S DINNER TIME!\"); } Notice that we're not saying cats[i] here. We're simply writing our function to accept a single parameter called cat , and we're processing that single cat in the function. Now that we've set the rule for how to handle a single cat, the forEach function can do the rest of the work for us! let cats = [\"Sylvester\", \"Tigger\", \"Mr. Bigglesworth\", \"Felix\", \"Simba\"]; let forOne = function(cat){ console.log(cat.toUpperCase() + \", IT'S DINNER TIME!\"); } cats.forEach(forOne); Try running the above code, and you'll notice that it does exactly what our earlier for loop did for us.

A variable's scope is determined by where it is declared , not assigned . global scope a variable in the global scope means that it is accessible from anywhere in the code. Variables declared outside of any function or code block are in the global scope. block scope a variable in block scope means that it is declared inside of a code block (between a set of {} ) and is only accessible within the code block that it was declared in code block a section of code enclosed in curly braces {} . It is used to group statements together, such as in functions, loops, and conditionals ReferenceError an error that occurs in JavaScript when you try to use a variable that hasn't been declared or is outside of its scope. Variable Scope Assignment Variable Scope Background We learned earlier that every data value in JavaScript has an associated type. We also learned that variables are like labels for associated values. We can think of a variable kind of like a named sticky note with its associated value written on the note. Whenever our code mentions the name of that particular sticky note, the JavaScript interpreter basically inserts the associated value into the code in place of the variable when that line executes. Up to this point in time, we've assumed that after we've declared a variable we can simply use it wherever we want. The reality is that this is not the case. Every variable has an associated scope. That scope is determined by where the variable is declared (not assigned). Scope is a topic that runs deep, but we're just going to focus on the two most common types of scope in this course: global scope and block scope. Global Scope Consider the following code snippet. function doStuff(){ console.log(\"entering doStuff function.\"); console.log(globalMessage); console.log(\"exiting doStuff function.\"); } let globalMessage = \"Hello from global scope\"; console.log(globalMessage); doStuff(); globalMessage is a global variable because it was declared outside of any code block. The fact that globalMessage is \"global\" means that the variable can be referenced \"globally\" - either outside of a function OR within a function like it is here. Global Scope Quick Exercise Try to guess what will be logged to the console from the above snippet and write it down. Then, run this code and see if you guessed correctly. Block Scope Block Scope is different from Global Scope because it limits from where a variable can be accessed from. Specifcally, a variable with block scope is only accessible from within the block of code it was declared in. Usually, this is either a function, loop, or conditional statement. Consider the following code snippet. function doStuff(){ console.log(\"entering doStuff function.\"); let localMessage = \"Hello from doStuff local scope\"; console.log(globalMessage); console.log(localMessage); console.log(\"exiting doStuff function.\"); } let globalMessage = \"Hello from global scope\"; console.log(globalMessage); doStuff(); console.log(localMessage); localMessage is a local variable , simply because it was declared inside of a code block -- in this case a function. The fact that localMessage is \"local\" means that the variable can be referenced \"locally\" within this particular function it was declared in. Block Scope Exercise Try to guess what will be logged to the console from the above snippet and write it down. Then, paste the above code into a JavaScript Replit and see if you guessed correctly. Did you notice that the last line caused an error? That is what happens when you try to access a variable outside of its associated scope. Whenever a line of code references a variable that does not exist or outside of its scope, a ReferenceError is thrown. Variable Scope Exercise Consider the following code snippet: function makeSounds(){ let dogSound = \"Bark\"; let catSound = \"Meow\"; humanSound = \"Hi\"; console.log(humanSound); console.log(dogSound); console.log(catSound); } let humanSound = \"Hello\"; let birdSound = \"Chirp\"; console.log(birdSound); makeSounds(); console.log(humanSound); console.log(dogSound); Answer the following questions in your quiz.md : Without actually running this code yet, write down what you think will be logged to the console.
