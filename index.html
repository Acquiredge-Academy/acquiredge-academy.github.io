                <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The goal of this course is not to turn you into a master JavaScript developer. In fact, coming out of this course, we're really just scratching the surface, which is precisely the point.</p>
<p>Mastering the ability to code is a career-long journey, but getting <strong>project-ready</strong>, where you are able to create real applications to see the results of your work doesn't have to be difficult. Most guides and tutorials out there tend to overload beginners with unnecessary details that distract them from the core concepts in the beginning.</p>
<p>By following through with this program, you will be able to go from "zero" (absolute beginner) to "project-ready" in the fastest way possible.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there will be links to additional readings, but the core material is focused on getting rid of distracting details so that we can focus on building and experimenting.</p>
<h2 id="guiding-philosophies-and-strategic-shortcuts">Guiding Philosophies and Strategic Shortcuts</h2>
<h3 id="hands-on-learning">Hands-On Learning</h3>
<p>Going through readings and videos can help build a basic understanding of code, but you're not going to fully "get it" without carefully working through exercises and examples.</p>
<p>Each reading aligns to coding exercises for you to complete in your assignment repository. <strong>You will need to make sure to import the correct assignment code prior to beginning your readings</strong>.</p>
<p>Content for each section builds on knowledge from prior sections. So, it's important to fully understand each section before moving to the next.</p>
<h3 id="emphasis-on-vocabulary">Emphasis on Vocabulary</h3>
<p>Learning technical vocabulary is <strong>super important</strong> for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Being able to speak using precise terms shows a high level of understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowing the right terms will help when you're asking for help, whether that be on the internet or from a person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll call out key terms in each section and link to a terminology table.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-pitfalls">Avoid Pitfalls</h3>
<p>Here are a list of common mistakes that many introductory coding students make. Try to follow these guidelines to maximize your learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Code in small chunks and test along the way. This will help you identify and fix errors early, before they get difficult to find.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When your code doesn't work, follow the scientific method: Hypothesize, test, learn, repeat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do NOT copy-paste code. If you're receiving help online, make sure to read, understand, and then write it yourself. The point in the beginning is to get as much practice as you can, and copy-pasting is simply robbing yourself of this practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose variable names that represent the data well. Avoid general names like <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embrace reading documentation. Most professionals rely on documentation more than any other resource.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="whats-being-simplified">What's being simplified</h2>
<h3 id="one-tool-for-every-job">One tool for every job</h3>
<p>We won't show you all of the different ways to copmlete a task in code. We'll show you the <em>one</em> way that is the <em>best option</em> 90% of the time.</p>
<h3 id="one-equality-operator">One equality operator</h3>
<p>Although we'll introduce the difference, we will not be using the <code>==</code> operator in this course, and we don't use it much in the real world, either. Stick to <code>===</code>.</p>
<h3 id="jquery-for-dom-manipulation-and-http-requests">JQuery for DOM manipulation and HTTP requests</h3>
<p>We've tried teaching "Vanilla JavaScript", but it's quite difficult to get the hang of in the beginning. Instead, we've opted to use JQuery because it simplifies a lot of concepts in DOM Manipulation and HTTP requests, which are concepts that can be difficult to understand as it is.</p>
<p>However, it is recommended to learn how to work without JQuery after you are comfortable with the concepts, and we will include resources for you to learn that after the course concludes.</p>
<h3 id="external-resources">External Resources</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you will be directed to utilize external resources for learning. Generally, this happens when another resource already does a good job of simplifying the information and concisely teaching a topic.</p>
<h2 id="note-about-chatgpt">Note about ChatGPT</h2>
<p>Do NOT ask ChatGPT to code for you in this coursee. It will not help you at this stage of your learning. You <em>can</em>, however, ask it to help explain concepts to you or find additional resources for you.</p>
<p>There's 2 main reasons why you shouldn't realy on ChatGPT just yet to help you with coding:</p>
<h3 id="1-hinders-learning">1. Hinders Learning</h3>
<p>Do you know what your main job as a programmer is? It's not actually coding. It's <strong>problem solving</strong> using code.</p>
<p>That being said, if you don't go through the motions of writing code on your own in the beginning, you'll never develop the skills of problem solving and logic, which will cause enormous issues for you when you actually try to get a job.</p>
<h3 id="2-chatgpt-sucks-at-coding">2. ChatGPT Sucks at Coding</h3>
<p>Seriously. Sometimes, ChatGPT will come up with some good code. But usually it comes up with code that is not optimal, efficient, or, worse, even correct! As a beginner, you won't have the experience to recognize these issues, leading to learning and developing poor coding practices.</p>
<p><strong>"But, professional developers say they use ChatGPT for work!"</strong>. Yes, it's true. Many professional developers <em>do</em> in fact use ChatGPT at work, and it can improve their work efficiency. <strong><em>However</em></strong>. You are not a professional developer (not yet, anyways).</p>
<p>The real reason why professionals use ChatGPT is because it can write code <strong>really fast</strong>, not because the code is of <strong>good quality</strong>. ChatGPT can write a lot of very simple boilerplate code very quickly, which a developer can then come back and implement the more difficult portions of.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Don't use ChatGPT to code just yet. You can use it to ask questions about concepts, or ask for advice on where to find resources. However, asking ChatGPT to code for you will only hinder your learning and cause you to come up with bad code.</p>
<p>Also, it's pretty obvious to any professional developer when we see AI-generated code.</p>
